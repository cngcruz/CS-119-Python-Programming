# Write a program to determine the drink size based on the letter the user enters.  
# Print a message to the  user giving the various drink size options and then prompt the user for the drink size.  
# The user can enter  an ‘s’ or ‘S’ for small, an ‘m’ or ‘M’ for medium, and an ‘l’ or ‘L’ for large.  
# Depending on which size the  user requests, print a message such as: “You have ordered a (small, medium, large) drink.” 
# In addition to  displaying the size ordered, also record a price multiplier.  
# The price multiplier for a small is 1, for a  medium is 2, and for a large is 3.  
# If the user does not enter a valid character, print an error message  (such as “Error: Invalid drink size”) and exit the program.  
# You should use nested if‐then‐else statements for this problem.  
# After the nested if‐then‐else statements, print the value of the price multiplier to ensure that the correct value was recorded 
#     (the  price multiplier will be used in program 4).  
#     Hint: use the logical OR expression in your comparisons.
