#Write the money collection interface for the vending machine.  
#Your program should tell the user the  price of the item and then the user will enter the amount of money that they are paying 
#    (this simulates them actually inserting cash).  
#If the money collected is less than the price, print an appropriate message  (such as: “Insufficient funds, no sale!”) 
#    and then the program should exit.  
#If enough money is collected,  determine the amount to return to the customer. 
#If the change due is not zero, tell the user how much  change they will receive.  
#Next print a message (such as “Thank you – enjoy your drink!”) and end the  program normally. 
#Note, your program should be able to handle all amounts of money (not just multiples of dollars but also  cents such as $1.25).  
#Also you may assume that the user is only entering a number and not the $  (though the $ could be part of your prompt).    
#Hint: Check how to do floating point comparisons!
