# Write a program to:
# Ask the student for  3 exam scores.
# Calculate the average score.
# Using a bunch of IF conditions, the computer should determine the grade and display the grade to the user. Use the following Criteria:
#  If Average is 98-100… Assign the grade “A+”
#  If Average is 95-97… Assign the grade “A”
#  If Average is 91-94… Assign the grade “A-”
# If Average is 88-90… Assign the grade “B+”
#  If Average is 84-87… Assign the grade “B”
#  If Average is 80-83… Assign the grade “B-”
# If Average is 75-79… Assign the grade “C+”
#  If Average is 70-74… Assign the grade “C”
#  If Average is less than 70 and greater than 60 assign grade “D”
#  If Average is less than or equal 60 assign grade "NC"

# Display the student name and the grade back to the student.
